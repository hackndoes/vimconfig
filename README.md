# vimconfig
my small change
VIM configuration with plugins and fun stuff

clone the repo to you home dir as .vim
git clone https://github.com/hackndoes/vimconfig.git ~/.vim

start VIM
ignore the error and press enter 

install all the vundle plugins
:PluginInstall
if some of the plugins fail to install on first pass simply run :PluginInstall again.

That's it you are ready to ROCK!!!!
